        <h2>How do we make sustainable fashion the easy choice?</h2>
        <p>
          We can do this by valuing our clothing, finding sustainable options nearby, and building a community that shifts
          from disposable wardrobes to intentional, lasting ones.

        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
          Re:Wear Hudson Valley is a guide to shopping sustainably, repairing clothing, and finding sustainable fashion 
          resources in the Hudson Valley. The goal of Re:Wear Hudson Valley is to make accessible the knowledge of local 
          slow fashion resources, and for conscious shopping to become second nature. When we truly value what we own,
          we start to make better purchasing choices, which naturally reduces both consumption and waste.
